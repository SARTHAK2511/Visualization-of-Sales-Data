               <ol>
                    <li>Data involves only 4 months - April , May , June and July.</li>
                    <li>April month has the most number of sales with contributing to 35.6 % of total sales.</li>
                    <li>It is also observed that as sales decreases as the month increases , the last month - July , has
                         the least number of sales.</li>

          <h3> The 19th and 21st of each month are somewhat more favoured by people , either can be due to discounts or
               other
               offers on that days</h3>

          <h2 style="text-align : center">My intincts & Further Possibilities</h2>
          <p>These are the observations that are observed by me , but there is much more possibility to gain other
               insights
               from this <br> data
               like , we can analyse dates wth products to observe are there any products that are sold together ? Is
               there
               any effect of months on type of products sold ? Like people tends to buy cold things on hot days and hot
               things on cold days <br></p>
